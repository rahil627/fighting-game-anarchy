# {{ site.title }}
a project and digital communal space passionate about fighting games,  
especially the research 'n development of them

![](knee-animation-hitbox.gif?raw=true)

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/FtAQws9)  
read 'n help make [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy/wiki)  
help make [*this* web-site](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy)

it's super simple to edit the wiki(!),  
*but the web-site needs permission to edit it.  
sooo much to dooo!! :) :)*

(todo: should create a forum, even if it's just for the nostalgia of smashboards :))   
*(use Disourse in a Docker container on a Digital Ocean server; DDD)*
