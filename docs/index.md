# the way of fighting games: an anarchy that shares interests in fighting games: a willowolf
is a digital anarchist diy community interested in the research and development of the art of fighting games

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/FtAQws9)  
if that's empty, you can read 'n help make [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy/wiki)  
if that's not enough, you can help make [*this* web-site](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy)!! The site is just as easy to edit as the wiki is. Just ask for permission to edit it. Sooo much to do!! :) :)  

# testing web-site area
