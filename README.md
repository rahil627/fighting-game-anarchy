welcome to
# {{ site.title-short }}
a project and digital communal space passionate about fighting games,  
especially the research 'n development of them

![](docs/assets/images/knee-animation-hitbox.gif?raw=true)

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/FtAQws9)  
read 'n help make [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy/wiki)  
help make [*this* web-site](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy)

it's super simple to edit the wiki(!),  
*but the web-site needs permission to edit it.  
sooo much to dooo!! :) :)*

(todo: should create a forum, even if it's just for the nostalgia of smashboards :))   
*(use Disourse in a Docker container on a Digital Ocean server; DDD)*  

# notes
site style / theme: ink 'n paper, or pencil 'n paper, or video game prototyping, or wireframes and highlighted collisions

todo:
clean up the repo; i think this was my first GitHub Pages site, so i was testing how GitHub Pages works here, and left a bunch of testing junk..

welp, the site works, but the theme doesn't...  
fixed: changed layout-value to `default`... a little strange though, what about `page` and `post` values?

cut:  
some traits: competitive, intuitive, *chill*, *siiiiick*, dope, *cognizant*.

Halp transform those lists into readable tables (csv vs flat-file database)
