# notes
site style / theme: ink 'n paper, or pencil 'n paper, or video game prototyping, or wireframes and highlighted collisions

todo:
clean up the repo; i think this was my first GitHub Pages site, so i was testing how GitHub Pages works here, and left a bunch of testing junk..

welp, the site works, but the theme doesn't...  
fixed: changed layout-value to `default`... a little strange though, what about `page` and `post` values?

cut:  
some traits: competitive, intuitive, *chill*, *siiiiick*, dope, *cognizant*.

Halp transform those lists into readable tables (csv vs flat-file database)
